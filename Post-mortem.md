# Foundry Frenzy Post Mortem

#### The Boomers: Ellie, Alex, Dan, Ben, Lewis, Sol

#
## Teamwork and Project Development

### GitHub

Not as good, maybe because the project was so different and the final goal was more open ended

### Communication

Improved, but once again hit crunch time due to people not able to complete things on time or stick to milestones

#
## The Game

### Code

Each touch is stored in a pooled list of touches with elements such as their movement phase, what they're tapping, etc tracked without the game getting confused about which touch is which.

### Design

#### The Foundry

Level design: open, Foundry colour palette

Our first concept of the game had it competitive with a split screen where two teams battled to run the best foundry but, upon evaluation, we felt it would be better if it was cooperative to reflect the foundry values of connectedness, and the teamwork vibe.

#### Bartle Player Types

The Socialiser is the most common Bartle player type and when combined with the game being multi-touch and cooperative, it made sense that people who fall under this category were our primary target audience.

Additionally, the game also appeals to the achiever, with rewards and benefits from doing well in the game reflected by the reputation tracker.
