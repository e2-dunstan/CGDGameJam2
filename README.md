- Wants to hold the fastest time to complete games.

### The Explorer (~10%)

## 
## The Game

Run the foundry with X number of employees. Tasks come in with a location, recommended number of people to assign, and a time to complete it. Meeting room -> workspaces (most time) -> presentation room (least time) -> complete. Final score could be saved to a leaderboard?

Tasks appear and shrink over time if not started.
