## 
## Bartle Player Types

#### Examples of how each type plays games

### The Achiever (~10%)
- Care about points and status.
- Collector and likes to display badges.
- Wants to hold the fastest time to complete games.

### The Explorer (~10%)
- Like to discover secrets and easter eggs.
- Repetitive tasks are fine as long as they are rewarded with more areas to explore.
- Like surprises and to be the first person to discover things/areas.

### The Socialiser (~80%)
- Enjoyment from interation with other players.
- Collaboration, joining forces, NOT competition.
- Farmville mums is a good example.

### The Killer (<1%)
- Similar to achievers by wanting to gain points and status.
- Like seeing other players lose, even better if they're the cause.
- Competitive, wants to be the best.

## 
## The Game

Run the Foundry with X number of employees. Tasks come in with a difficulty, recommended number of people to assign, and a time to complete it. Meeting room -> workspaces (most time) -> presentation room (least time) -> complete. Final score is dependent on reputation and tasks completed.
